<h1>Car Price Prediction Project</h1>
<h3>Project Overview </h3>
<p>Welcome to the Car Price Prediction project. This repository contains a Jupyter notebook Project_Cars.ipynb that showcases an end-to-end machine learning project aimed at predicting used car prices. The notebook includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model building.</p>

<h3>Dataset</h3>
<p>The project utilizes the Used_cars.csv dataset, which comprises various features that describe the characteristics of used cars, including make, model, year, mileage, and other relevant attributes that could influence the car's market price.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<h4>Key steps and features of this project include: </h4>
<ul>
<li>Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and outliers to improve model accuracy.</li>
<li>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data to understand trends and patterns.</li>
<li>Feature Engineering: Creating new features that can better represent the underlying pattern in the data for the predictive models. </li>
<li>Model Building: Training and evaluating several machine learning models to find the most accurate one for our price prediction. </li>
<li>Validation: Using cross-validation techniques to ensure the model's performance is consistent across different subsets of the dataset. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
<ul>
<li>Python 3: The primary programming language used. </li>
<li>Jupyter Notebook: An open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. </li>
<li>Pandas: A fast, powerful, flexible, and easy-to-use open-source data analysis and manipulation tool. </li>
<li>NumPy: An essential component in the burgeoning Python visualization landscape, which allows Python to function as a powerful and efficient multi-dimensional array processing library. </li>
<li>Matplotlib/Seaborn: These libraries provide a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. </li>
<li>Scikit-learn: A machine learning library that provides simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis. </li>
</ul>
